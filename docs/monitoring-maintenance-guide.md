# Monitoring & Maintenance Guide

## 1. Application Monitoring (APM)
- Integrate Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/httptrace`, `/actuator/prometheus`)
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics collection and dashboards
- Optionally use Application Performance Monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Elastic APM)
- Monitor JVM, DB, HTTP, and custom business metrics

## 2. Error Tracking & Alerting
- Integrate Sentry or Rollbar for real-time error tracking
- Configure alerting in Grafana or via email/Slack for critical errors
- Set up alert thresholds for latency, error rates, resource usage

## 3. Log Aggregation
- Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki + Grafana for centralized log management
- Configure Spring Boot to output logs in JSON for easier parsing
- Forward logs to log aggregator using Filebeat or Fluentd

## 4. Performance Monitoring
- Use Grafana dashboards for latency, throughput, error rate, and resource usage
- Regularly review `/actuator/metrics` and custom business KPIs

## 5. Maintenance Procedures
- Schedule regular dependency updates (`mvn versions:display-dependency-updates`)
- Review security scan reports and patch vulnerabilities
- Rotate secrets and credentials periodically
- Test backup and restore procedures quarterly
- Document all maintenance activities

## 6. Automated Backups
- Use `pg_dump` for daily PostgreSQL backups (see deployment guide)
- Store backups securely (cloud/offsite)
- Automate backup scripts with cron or CI/CD
- Monitor backup job success/failure and alert on issues
